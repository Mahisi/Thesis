In this thesis, the proposed methodology for program code dependency analysis is designed as an end-to-end solution. The process begins with the collection of TypeScript source code from real software projects, which serves as the raw input for analysis. The system then parses the code using the TypeScript Compiler API to generate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and semantic tables that capture the structure, symbols, and relationships within the program. Based on this structured data, the method systematically identifies module interconnections, import–export relationships, and potential circular dependencies.

The workflow represents a complete analytical pipeline — from data acquisition and parsing to dependency extraction, visualization, and reporting — ensuring that every stage contributes to a deeper understanding of the codebase. This holistic approach demonstrates the essence of an end-to-end system: instead of analyzing code fragments in isolation, the methodology integrates syntax, semantics, and dependency structure into a single coherent framework.

The results reveal how different architectural or organizational patterns influence software modularity and coupling. By transforming raw code into structured dependency insights, the system bridges the gap between static analysis and practical software engineering, supporting developers in refactoring decisions, improving maintainability, and ensuring overall structural integrity of complex TypeScript projects.
