This directory contains all prompt templates used to interact with the AI agent of the thesis system “Research on Program Code Analysis Techniques.”

The goal of these prompts is to conceptualize the dependency analysis system as a single intelligent agent, which receives TypeScript project input X and returns analysis results y by executing all internal stages end-to-end:

Data Understanding → Semantic Inference → Reasoning → Output Generation
(AST parsing → Symbol resolution → Dependency extraction → DSM → Reports)
